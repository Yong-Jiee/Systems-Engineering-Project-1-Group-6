  # --- Coordinate Frames ---
  global_frame: map                # Align local costmap with global 'map' frame
  robot_base_frame: base_link      # Robotâ€™s base reference frame for transforms

  # --- Update & Publish Rates ---
  update_frequency: 5.0            # Update costmap at high frequency for responsive local planning [was 0.3]
  publish_frequency: 1             # Publish updates to visualization at 1 Hz [was 2.0]

  # --- Map Behavior ---
  static_map: false                # Build costmap from live sensors only (no static map)
  rolling_window: true             # Keep local costmap centered around the robot

  # --- Costmap Dimensions ---
  width: 1.5                       # Width of the local costmap (meters)
  height: 1.5                      # Height of the local costmap (meters)
  resolution: 0.025                # High-resolution grid for fine obstacle representation [was 0.05]

  # --- TF Settings ---
  transform_tolerance: 0.5         # Time allowed to find a valid TF transform

  # --- Inflation Settings ---
  cost_scaling_factor: 3           # Moderate slope for cost drop-off near obstacles [was 7]
  inflation_radius: 0.01           # Very tight inflation zone (for narrow spaces) [was 0.03]

  # --- Active Layers ---
  plugins:
    - {name: obstacles_laser, type: "costmap_2d::ObstacleLayer"}   # Mark/clear using LIDAR scan
    - {name: inflation,       type: "costmap_2d::InflationLayer"}  # Inflate cost around detected obstacles
